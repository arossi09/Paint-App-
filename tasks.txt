Due Monday: Paint 2.0

Clicking on shape allows you to select it. Then we can change color by selecting a new one
Or drag and drop to change its location.

Consider a method "Contains" that calcs if something is contained inside a shape
//attribute selected in shape as a true/false. This will need a setter.
//so we need a selected outline, draw the outline from the outline methods probably
// when you choose a new color, needs to check for a selected shape I guess to change that fill color
//undo doesnâ€™t have to work for a color change

Drag&Drop

If the first click is on an empty space, but if over a shape, we will drag it. Not a click but a "press" on
A shape.
If you want to do it with something other than a click, like double or Cntrl+click
